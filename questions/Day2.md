DAY 2: TERMINO

Write a function named termino that takes in a string of parentheses and returns the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid as an integer (i.e. each open parenthesis is closed).

For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.
