OOPs

 

Contrary to what the title implies, this task was not a mistake.

OOP==Object Oriented Programming

 

Create a class Student.

Every student has an age, weight and height

 

Create a constructor that takes in 3 parameters, a students age,weight and height(in that order)

and initializes them to those values

 

Create a function info() which when called by a student object RETURNS a tuple containing the age and Body Max Index(BMI)(rounded to 2dp) of the student

BMI=weight/(height**2)

The function info() will not take any parameters

 

Lastly create a function average() which takes a list of student objects and RETURNS a tuple containing the average age,weight and height(in that order) of the students in the next 10 years

i.e 10 years from now what would be their average age,weight and height(in that order)

 

Assume that weight increases by 5% each year and height increases by 2% each year.

 

NOTE:

•Age is an integer, weight and height are floats

•Ensure functions take parameters in the order given.

•Your float answers should be rounded to 2 dp

•Only assertion errors should be raised if necessary

 

e.g

 

Fortune=Student(23,45.67,7.6)

represents a student whose age is 23, weight is 45.67 and height is 7.6

 

Fortune.info() would return (23,0.79)

 

another student

Joba=Student(22,40.01,8.3)

 

 

average([Fortune,Joba]) would return (32.5,69.78,9.69)

 

e.g for weight in 10 years Joba will weigh 65.17 while Fortune will weigh 74.39 and the average of that is 69.78

 

 

Goodluck. Sorry for the long epistle.
